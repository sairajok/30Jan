        I miss us in our school days, whenever i see your school child pic in my wallet it hits me with nostalgia
        how we used to share our things just so we can talk with each other, our long conversations during the
        free period also sharing snacks sometimes, attending classes everyday just so i can see you clearly unknown about tht  we are going to date each other.
        Form besfriends to lovers what a beautiful thing right? When i started to have feelings for you i was like 
        nahh i won't even get chance to date her she's just so pretty but i was lucky enough that u also had a crush
        on me yayieeee!!! We used to say I love you before even getting in a relationship, I miss those days ngl
        And finally after being bestfriends for decades a day came where we become partners. 
        A very very special day!

In the light they shine with different shades, each one more beautiful than the last. People underestimate brown eyes, but yours have the power to bring me to my knees with just one look.`,

        voice: `Oh, how I long to hear your voice. That beautiful laugh of yours makes me forget that anything else exists in the world. The sound of your voice in my ear is what I crave the most, more than the air I breathe. Hearing my name from your lips is my favorite sound in the universe.`,

Even when we argue or when I'm upset, you always try to see my side and help me through things. That kind of emotional connection means more to me than I can ever fully explain. I love you so much babyyy!`

    <h2>Happy 2 Years, My Love ❤️</h2>
    <p>I can’t believe we’ve spent two years together. When I’m with you, time just moves so fast, and I don’t even know why. I want to wish us a very happy two years of love and all the efforts we’ve put into this relationship.

I love you a lot — I can’t even imagine life without you. You’re the best girlfriend, and I would love to spend all my coming years just like this, with you by my side. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have a beautiful girl like you.

Through every up and down we’ve faced in these two years, we’ve always fixed things together — and I know we’ll keep doing that in every year to come. Just hold my hand forever and ever. I love you A LOTTTT BBG ❤️
